.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs multiple
.Xr rtpdump 1
sessions simultaneously.
For every
.Oo Ar address Oc Ns / Ns Ar port ,
one
.Xr rtpdump 1
process is started accordingly.
The dumps are stored in
.Pa basename.* ,
numbered from
.Pa basename.1
increasingly.
The
.Fl F ,
.Fl t
and
.Fl x
flags, if present, are passed to every
.Xr rtpdump 1
process.
.Pp
If the
.Fl t
flags is used,
.Nm
will wait for all the
.Xr rtpdump 1
processes to finish.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will need to be killed with a signal,
in which case it kills the running processes as well.
