.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
translates RTP/RTCP packets arriving from one of the specified addresses
to all the other addresses.
Addresses can be multicast or unicast.
The port number must be an even number.
The optional TTL values are ignored for unicast addresses.
.Pp
Additionally, the translator can translate VAT packets into RTP packets.
VAT control packets are translated into RTCP SDES packets
with a CNAME and a NAME entry.
However, this is only intended to be used in the following configuration:
VAT packets arriving on a multicast connection are translated into RTP
and sent over a unicast link.
RTP packets are not yet translated into VAT packets
and packets arriving on unicast links are not changed at all.
Therefore, only the following topology is supported:
.Dq multicast VAT -> translator -> unicast RTP
on the way in and
.Dq multicast VAT <- translator <- unicast VAT
on the way back.
This means that the audio agent on the unicast link
should be able to use both VAT and RTP.
